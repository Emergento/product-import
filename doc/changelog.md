## 1.1.1 : Fix for duplicate images

Images with _[d]. (where [d] is a series of decimals) in the filename were duplicated on updates.

## 1.1.0 : Category path url-rewrites - 16-09-2018

Added the option to remove category path url-rewrites.

If a shop does not use category paths in its urls, url_rewrite generation can be simplified a lot. This saves time and reduces the size of the url_rewrite table.

Based on the ideas from [fisheyehq/module-url-rewrite-optimiser](https://github.com/fisheyehq/module-url-rewrite-optimiser)

## 1.0.0 : Public release - 10-09-2018

Publication on Github, into the public domain.
